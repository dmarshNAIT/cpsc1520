Fetch Fundamentals

This example requires you to send a local fetch request for a JSON
file, and to render the following HTML for each of the returned objects
in the array.
    
Sample HTML
    <div class="mt-3 card" >
        <img class="card-img-top" src="CAT PICTURE HERE" alt="Card image cap">
        <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">CAT NAME HERE </h5>
        <p class="card-text">CAT TEXT HERE</p>
        </div>
    </div>

Use the following list as a guide to complete the task:

- select any requried elements from the document
- create a getCats function that will fetch the local cats-with-jobs.json file
    - the function should accept a function parameter, that will be called 
      when the data has been resolved, and passed the array of fetched cats
      as a single argument
- create a renderCats function that will accept a single parameter, which
  should be an array of cat data
    - the function should iterate over the array (e.g. use .forEach()) and render
      each cat using the template HTML provided above
- call the getCats function, and pass in the renderCats function as an argument
    - when the page loads, you should now see the cats rendered on the page
