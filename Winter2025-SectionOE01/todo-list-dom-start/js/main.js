/*
  Add the required JavaScript to handle form submit and add a new todo item to 
  the page (in the div.todo-list element).  You will need to use a counter to 
  uniquely identify each todo item and use only DOM API functions to interact
  with the document (i.e. create each todo item), DO NOT use innerHTML for this
  exercise.
