These are the examples we worked on together in our live classes.

As these are live examples, we may take some shortcuts or leave out some sections due to time constraints (or to leave you homework challenges for your own practice): please let me know if you notice any unexpected errors or gaps.

Thanks!

# Extensions
Some extensions I recommend:
- [W3C Web Validator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CelianRiboulet.webvalidator)
    - This validates your HTML without leaving VS Code.
    - ðŸ”¥ Tip: in settings enable "Validate On Save" and it'll auto-validate and give you a helpful pop-up confirmation every time you save your HTML file.
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
    - Check your JavaScript for bugs & poor practices.
