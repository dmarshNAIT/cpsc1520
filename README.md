These are the examples we worked on together in our live classes.

> üóíÔ∏è As these are live examples, we may take some shortcuts or leave out some sections due to time constraints (or to leave you homework challenges for your own practice): please let me know if you notice any unexpected errors or gaps.

Thanks!

# Extensions
Some extensions I recommend:
- [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)
    - A spell checker that checks for typos in your code and comments. It's smart enough to understand a variable like `myNumber` and parse the individual words that make up the variable name!
- [W3C Web Validator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CelianRiboulet.webvalidator)
    - This validates your HTML without leaving VS Code.
    - üî• Tip: in settings enable "Validate On Save" and it'll auto-validate and give you a helpful pop-up confirmation every time you save your HTML file.
- [open in browser](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=techer.open-in-browser)
    - As the name suggests: adds "open in browser" to the right-click context menu in your VS Code Explorer. That means we can open an .html file with one click instead of two: what will we do with all our extra time?!
- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
    - This creates a server on your computer that will automatically reload your webpage every time you make changes to the .html. Here's a [walk-through of how to use it and why it's awesome](https://medium.com/@aleksej.gudkov/how-to-use-live-server-in-visual-studio-code-for-real-time-web-development-c1914a4e7f24).
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
    - Check your JavaScript for bugs & poor practices.
- [VSCODE-TODO-HIGHLIGHT](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight)
    - If you like leaving yourself `TODO` comments in your code, this handy extension highlights them so you don't forget an important task.
